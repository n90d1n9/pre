 * Append-only store for project cost and revenue entries.

 * These entries are deliberately not part of the {@code Project}
 * aggregate: a real project can carry thousands of them, and loading
 * them with the project lifecycle would be disastrous. They arrive
 * from other bounded contexts (Accounting, Payables, Billing) and are
 * only aggregated for project profitability reporting.
 *
 * The contract stays synchronous on purpose - it is a simple append
 * and read projection, mirroring the budget capability's store port.
